# Access key need for authentication, so you should to keep it in safe place

# if you use not only alphabet letters and digits, you should wrap in quotes
# access_key value. You will use this access_key aka token for webhooks.
# But because almost all systems offer naked URL for webhooks, without possibility of
# authentication settings (username/password) or setting custom http auth header,
# your access_key maybe easily compromise (http sniffers aka middle man attack),
# I strongly recommend you setup Nginx/Apache with HTTPS as frontend and
# run api.py behind of it.
